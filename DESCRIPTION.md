# Create a simple TodoList

## Description
Create a simple todo list application using your favorite language, along with a short summary that outlines some details about your design and implementation. It's important to note that this exercise should take a few hours at most â€” we only want to assess your ability to design a program, write some code, and explain it. Your output should be a simple program that allows the user to take a few actions:

*  Add a todo list item
*  Delete an item
*  Update an item

## Methodology
We encourage you to use the stack you're most comfortable with. We're also not grading your front-end design skills, so no need to spend a lot of time perfecting your CSS.
We'll also use this example later in the process if you interview in person with us, asking you to present to one of our team members and talk through your work.

## Evaluation
When you're done, push the project to Github or place in a zip file and return along with a short summary outlining:

*  How you approached this problem.
*  Why you picked the language/framework you did.
*  How you might extend this if you were building a more robust instance of the same application.
